# Advanced CSS Course By Jonas Schmedtman from Udemy

* How CSS works under the hood?
* Advanced positioning
* Grid
* Flexbox
* Animation
* CSS Architecture

It's an awesome course, so highly recommended. I was looking for something to clear things up in my head. I did not want to start from the beginning because I have been using CSS for about two years, but lately I realised that there are gaps in my CSS knowledge, so this is why I took this course.
